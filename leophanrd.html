            <h2>Venues where Leopards are found </h2>
            <p>Leopards in Sri Lanka are known for their adaptation to various habitats, including both dry 
                and wet zones. Keep in mind that leopard sightings in the wild are not guaranteed, as these 
                animals are naturally elusive and may be challenging to spot. Visitors to these national 
                parks should maintain a respectful distance from wildlife and follow ethical wildlife viewing 
                practices.

                <p>Sri Lanka boasts a rich tapestry of wildlife, and for those seeking the elusive leopard, Yala National Park stands out as a premier destination. Nestled in the southeastern region, Yala is renowned for hosting one of the highest densities of leopards globally. The park's diverse ecosystems provide an ideal habitat for these majestic big cats, making it a hot spot for wildlife enthusiasts. Beyond leopards, Yala is a haven for biodiversity, featuring elephants, sloth bears, crocodiles, and a myriad of bird species. The dry season, spanning from May to September, is often recommended for optimal wildlife sightings.</p>

                     and a rich array of birdlife. The park's vastness allows for a more serene and immersive 
                     wildlife experience. Visiting during the dry season, from February to October, enhances

            <h3>Udawalawa National Park</h3>

                <img src="udawalawa leophard.jpg" alt="Leophard in Udawalawe" class="FoundImg">
                <p>In the southern reaches of Sri Lanka, Udawalawe National Park offers a distinctive blend of
                     grasslands and the Udawalawe Reservoir, providing a vital water source for its inhabitants
                     . While elephants take center stage in Udawalawe, leopards also find a home here, offering
                      visitors a unique opportunity to witness both species coexisting. The park not only showcases the splendor of Sri Lanka's wildlife but plays a pivotal role in conservation, particularly for displaced elephants. Optimal wildlife viewing is often during the dry season, from May to September.</p>

        <h2>Threats For Sri lankan Leopard </h2>
        <h3>Habitat Loss and Fragmentation</h3>
        <div class="LeophardFlex">
            <img src="threats 1.jpg" alt="Threat img" class="ThreatsImg">
            <p>Habitat loss and fragmentation pose significant threats to leopard populations in Sri Lanka. 
            As human populations expand, forests are often cleared for agriculture, infrastructure, and 
            urban development. This results in fragmented habitats, isolating leopard populations and 
            hindering their ability to roam and find mates.The consequences of habitat loss and 
            fragmentation include reduced prey availability, increased human-wildlife conflict, and 
            restricted gene flow among leopard populations. This can lead to inbreeding and a decline in 
            overall genetic diversity.<br>

        <h3>Human-Wildlife Conflict</h3>
        <div class="LeophardFlex">
            <img src="wilpattuwa leophard.jpg" alt="Threats image" class="ThreatsImg">
            <p>Human-wildlife conflict arises as leopards come into contact with human settlements, leading to 
                conflicts over resources such as livestock. Retaliatory killings and capture of leopards due to 
                perceived threats to human safety are common consequences.The consequences of human-wildlife 
                conflict include negative perceptions of leopards, loss of leopard lives, and potential 
                disruptions in the natural behavior of these predators. This conflict undermines conservation 
                efforts and endangers both leopards and local communities.</p>
